## SQL Portfolio

In this portfolio, I've compiled a collection of SQL queries and database management tasks to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL. From foundational concepts to advanced techniques, each section highlights a different aspect of SQL that I've mastered.

## Introduction to SQL

In this section, I've provided an introduction to SQL, the standard language for managing relational databases. You'll find basic SQL queries for creating tables, inserting data, and retrieving information, showcasing my understanding of fundamental SQL concepts.

## Grouping in SQL

Grouping in SQL is essential for summarising data and generating reports. Here, I demonstrate my ability to use SQL's GROUP BY clause to group rows with similar values and perform aggregate functions to analyse data effectively.

## Combining Data With JOINs and UNIONs

The ability to combine data from multiple tables or queries is crucial in database management. In this section, I showcase my proficiency in using JOINs and UNIONs to merge datasets, demonstrating different types of JOINs and the UNION operator for data manipulation.

## Advanced JOINs and NULLs

Advanced JOIN operations and handling NULL values are vital for complex data retrieval and analysis. Here, I delve into more advanced JOIN techniques, including self-joins and multi-table joins, while also addressing the challenges posed by NULL values in SQL queries.

## Subqueries in SQL

Subqueries, or nested queries, offer a powerful way to retrieve data based on conditions from within another query. In this section, I demonstrate my ability to use subqueries effectively to retrieve specific datasets or perform complex data filtering.

## Functions in SQL

SQL functions play a key role in performing operations on data, ranging from mathematical calculations to string manipulations. Here, I showcase my proficiency in using SQL functions for various purposes, including aggregations, date/time operations, and data transformations.

Each section of this portfolio is accompanied by SQL code snippets and explanations, providing insight into my SQL skills and how I apply them to solve real-world data management and analysis challenges. Whether you're looking for a SQL expert to manage databases, optimise queries, or extract insights from data, this portfolio demonstrates my readiness to take on SQL-related tasks with confidence and expertise.
